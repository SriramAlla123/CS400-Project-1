Mohammed woke up on a bright Sunday morning, stretching and yawning. "Vader!", he called out. No response. He wondered that his beagle hadn't woken up yet. He got out of bed, and started his usual morning routine. If this was some other day, Vader would be up and wagging his tail around Mohammed. But little did Mohammed know he would never see Vader again. With a slice of toast in his hand, he searched his small apartment, but could not find Vader anywhere. He searched outside his apartment, near the park, by the lake, everywhere, but all in vain. Vader was nowhere to be found. He called his friends and family, whomever he could think of, to ask if anyone knew anything anout Vader, but he was unsuccessful again. It was as if Vader had vanished into thin air.
